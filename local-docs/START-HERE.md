## 🤔 Common Questions

### "The images show placeholders?"
**Normal!** The portfolio has graceful fallbacks. Add your images to see the real design.

### "Can I customize the text?"
**Absolutely!** Edit `index.html` and `about.html` directly. The content is yours to refine.

### "How do I change colors?"
**Easy!** Edit variables at top of `styles/main.css`. All colors are defined once and used throughout.

### "What about the split-face hero image?"
**Use the guide!** `HERO-IMAGE-GUIDE.md` has step-by-step instructions for Figma, Photoshop, or online tools.

### "When should I create case study pages?"
**After images are added.** We'll do those together. They'll follow the same clean design system.
